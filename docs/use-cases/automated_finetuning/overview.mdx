Real-world use cases often deal with dynamic data that is updated regularly. MindsDB enables you to automate [fine-tuning](/mindsdb_sql/sql/api/finetune) of AI models to keep them up-to-date and as accurate as possible. You can set up [jobs](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs) that will trigger fine-tuning of AI models every time new data arrives.
