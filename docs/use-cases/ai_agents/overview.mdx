AI Agents are an extension of large language models (LLMs). They can access external tools, such as search engines, via API calls, overcoming some common shortcomings of LLMs, such as lack of access to internal business data. With MindsDB, you can customize and deploy [AI agents](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent).
