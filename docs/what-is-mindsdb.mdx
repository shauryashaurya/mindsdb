We believe AI will help every company thrive. But off-the-shelf, generic AI doesn’t completely meet anyone’s needs.

With MindsDB and its nearly 200 integrations to [data sources](/integrations/data-overview) and [AI/ML frameworks](/integrations/ai-overview), any developer can use their enterprise data to customize AI for their purpose, faster and more securely.

## Features

MindsDB integrates with numerous [data sources](/integrations/data-overview), including databases, vector stores, and applications, and popular [AI/ML frameworks](/integrations/ai-overview), including AutoML and LLMs. Doing so, MindsDB brings data and AI together, enabling intuitive implementation and automation of AI systems.

Common concepts and features brought by MindsDB include the following:

Manage every aspect of AI models, including creation, deployment, training, fine-tuning, and version control.
</Card>

<Card title="AI Integrations" icon="link" href="/ai-integrations">
MindsDB gives you access to a wide range of AI/ML frameworks within your enterprise data environment. This includes models from OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, Anyscale, and more.
</Card>

<Card title="Data Integrations" icon="link" href="/data-integrations">
Connect any data source to MindsDB, including databases, vector stores, and applications.
</Card>

<Card title="Automation" icon="link" href="/automation">
Automate tasks with [JOBS](/sql/create/jobs) by scheduling execution at defined frequency, or with [TRIGGERS](/sql/create/trigger) by defining a triggering event.
</Card>

<Note>
An innovation introduced by MindsDB is the ability to abstract AI models as [virtual tables](/generative-ai-tables) that you can [SELECT FROM](/sql/get-single-prediction), [JOIN](/sql/get-batch-predictions) with data, and [FINE-TUNE](/sql/api/finetune) from any data source using any [AI engine](/integrations/ai-overview).
